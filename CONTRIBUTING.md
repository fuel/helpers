# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/fuel/helpers).

## Pull Requests

- **[Fuel Coding Standard](https://fuelphp.com/docs/general/coding_standards.html)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [Fuel PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/fuel/code-sniffer).

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Pull request only to the develop branch** - The main branch contains the released versions, changes will never be accepted on already released code!

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.

## Running Tests

``` bash
$ composer test
```

**Happy coding**!
